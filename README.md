# TumorTrace: AI-based MRI Scanning for Breast Cancer Patients

## TumorTrace is a deep learning project aimed at classifying tumor images based on their features. It utilizes computer vision techniques and neural networks to automate the detection of tumors in medical images. The project leverages advanced image processing and machine learning methods to help healthcare professionals in the early detection and diagnosis of tumors.

## Features

💾 **Image Classification**: Classifies tumor images into categories like benign or malignant.

🧐 **Deep Learning Model**: Uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for efficient feature extraction and classification.

🔄 **Data Preprocessing**: Includes data augmentation, normalization, and splitting into training and testing sets.

## Technologies Used

🐉 **Python**: The primary programming language for implementation.

💪 **PyTorch**: Deep learning framework used for model development.

🔠 **OpenCV**: Image processing library used for preprocessing images.

🌄 **Scikit-learn**: For additional machine learning tools and metrics.

🎨 **Matplotlib**: For visualizing training progress and results.
